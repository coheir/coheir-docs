# All code in Coheir is - by default - open source with unlicense

* Deciders: Johny Woller Skovdal, David Dyrholm and Carsten JÃ¸rgensen
* Status: Approved

## Context and problem status

What license should we operate under? There are many to choose from, and a lot of different reasons to choose one over the other. One must be settled upon, and if a new project is started, the chosen license here should be used.

Details about licenses can be found here: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/

## Considered options

* MIT License - One of the most widely used within Open Source. Only requires to copy the license.
* GNU LGPLv3 - A rather restrictive license, but helps making sure that the project grows. Software using our software licensed under this, will require them to adopt the same license, resulting in more Open Source code.
* Unlicense - The least restrictive of them all. No license inclusion needed even.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: "Unlicense", because it best fits what we want to achieve. No strings attached, we are here to help each other out.

We do, however, also want to require that our software is always Open Source, even though the license does not explicitly require it.
