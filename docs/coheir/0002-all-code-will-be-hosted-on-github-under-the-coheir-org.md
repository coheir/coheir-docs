# All code will be hosted on GitHub under the Coheir org

* Deciders: Johny Woller Skovdal

## Context and problem statement

Where should source code for Coheir be hosted? Can we use different platforms? Should we self-host or use public or private hosted repos?

## Considered options

* GitHub - primary platform for hosting Open Source
* Azure DevOps - mature integration with Azure and better PR flow
* GitLabs - even more options, but self hosted

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: "GitHub" - even though GitHub does not have the most features, it is the easiest to onboard people on, and it fits the Unlicense choice
